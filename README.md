The Stephen Weldon Gallery was created to display the paintings and sculpture of Stephen Weldon.
Stephen wanted a site for potential clients to inquire about the purchase of his work or commissions. He requested that he would communicate or negotiate with clients through email alone, with no e-commerce system for purchases.
Other than that I had free reign over the design and development of the site. I created a front facing site for users and a Content Management System (CMS) site to give Weldon the ability to update his gallery.
